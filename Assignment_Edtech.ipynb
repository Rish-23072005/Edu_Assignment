        "Create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system based on an economics book chapter (\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lp458XgSTjYU6hnfNMbj1rpzXCCp8q81/view\") and a YouTube playlist (\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPV1BOs1ISI&list=PLILm2q4LQTsFpnZdYRph_BNRfv36zxEV6\"). The system should create a vector database for generating questions and assessing student answers. The code should create clean searchable knowledge with metadata (subject, topic, subtopic, difficulty), index the content in an object store and vector DB, potentially create a knowledge graph, and auto-create lesson pages from videos including overview, time-stamped highlights, key terms, 5 multiple-choice questions, and 1 essay question. The final output should be a working MVP using classes and objects, with testing, a demo link, a GitHub repository with a README, and prepared for email submission."
